      <h3>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h3>
      <h4>Data Protection</h4>
      <p>
        The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We
        treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection
        regulations and this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that
        can be used to personally identify you. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect
        and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by email) can
        have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
        possible.
      </p>

      <h4>Information about the Data Controller</h4>
      <p>The data controller for data processing on this website is:</p>
      <p>
        {{ personalInfo.name }}<br />
        {{ personalInfo.addressLine1 }}<br />
        {{ personalInfo.addressLine2 }}<br />
        {{ personalInfo.addressLine3 }}<br />
        {{ personalInfo.addressLine4 }}<br />
      </p>
      <p>Email: {{ personalInfo.email }}</p>
      <p>
        The data controller is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others,
        decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses,
        etc.).
      </p>

      <h4>Storage Duration</h4>
      <p>
        Unless a specific storage period is specified within this Privacy Policy, your personal data
        will remain with us until the purpose for data processing ceases to apply. If you make a
        legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
        deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data
        (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take
        place after these reasons cease to apply.
      </p>
      <h4>General Information about the Legal Basis of Data Processing on this Website</h4>
      <p>
        If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, we process your personal data
        based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data are processed
        according to Art. 9(1) GDPR. In case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to
        third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have
        consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via
        device fingerprinting), the processing is additionally based on ยง 25(1) TTDSG. The consent
        can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or
        for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art.
        6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary for the fulfillment of
        a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our
        legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The specific legal basis for each
        individual data processing operation can be found in the following paragraphs of this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h4>Recipient of Personal Data</h4>
      <p>
        In the course of our business activities, we work with various external entities. In some
        cases, the transmission of personal data to these external entities is necessary. We only
        disclose personal data to external entities if this is required for the performance of a
        contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax
        authorities), if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the
        disclosure, or if another legal basis permits the data disclosure. When using data
        processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for
        data processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
      </p>
      <h4>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h4>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke
        your consent at any time. The legality of data processing carried out before the revocation
        remains unaffected by the revocation.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
      </h4>
      <p>
        IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT, ON
        GROUNDS RELATING TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
        PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE
        LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT,
        WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING
        LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR IF
        THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO
        ART. 21(1) GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
        OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH
        ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT
        ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR
        DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
      </p>

      <h4>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority</h4>
      <p>
        In the case of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint
        with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence,
        their place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a
        complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
      </p>
      <h4>Right to Data Portability</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data, which we process automatically based on your consent or in
        fulfillment of a contract, handed over to you or to a third party in a common,
        machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another responsible
        party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
      </p>
      <h4>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h4>
      <p>
        Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information
        about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data
        processing, as well as a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as
        well as for further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.
      </p>

      <h4>Right to Restrict Processing</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For
        this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restrict processing exists in the
        following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to
          verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the
          restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the processing of your personal data is unlawful, you can request the restriction of
          data processing instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or
          assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing
          of your personal data instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck
          between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail,
          you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data โ apart from its
        storage โ may only be processed with your consent or for the purpose of asserting,
        exercising, or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal
        person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.
      </p>

      <h4>SSL/TLS Encryption</h4>
      <p>
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders
        or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL/TLS encryption.
        You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser
        changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL/TLS
        encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Data Collection on this Website</h3>
      <h4>Contact Form:</h4>
      <p>
        When you submit inquiries to us via the contact form, the information you provide in the
        inquiry form, including the contact details you provide, will be stored with us for the
        purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We will not disclose
        this data without your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing of this data is based on Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection
        Regulation (GDPR) if your inquiry is related to the performance of a contract or is
        necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
        processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries
        directed to us (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has
        been requested; consent can be revoked at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request deletion,
        revoke your consent for storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g.,
        after completing the processing of your inquiry). Mandatory legal provisions โ especially
        retention periods โ remain unaffected.
